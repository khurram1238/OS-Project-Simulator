# 🖥️ OS Simulation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simulation of key Operating System concepts implemented in C++. It is developed as part of our semester project and demonstrates the working of core OS functionalities such as:

- CPU Scheduling Algorithms (FCFS, Round Robin, SJF, etc.)
- Memory Management (Paging, Segmentation)
- Inter-Process Communication (Pipes, Shared Memory)
- Deadlock Detection and Avoidance
- Process Management Simulation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Git & GitHub for Version Control
- Linux (for simulation/testing)
- g++ Compiler

---

## 🧪 Project Structure
We have used **three main branches** for effective version management:

- `main`: Contains the most stable release of the project.
- `dev`: Contains the in-progress development version.
- `feature-scheduler`: A dedicated branch for the scheduling algorithms module.
